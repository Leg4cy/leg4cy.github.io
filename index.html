                        <h2 class="major">In love with Technology since 1998...</h2>
                        <p>I was always curious when I was a kid, <i>/* ain't we all? */</i> I always wanted to understand how things worked, in fact, I was so curious that when my dad's computer broke the first thing that occurred to me in my head was to open it and disassemble
                            it all, piece by piece. I still remember it as if it was today, the shock reaction when my mom came into the room and started screaming with her hands over her hair and saying "You will never be able to get all of it together
                            - ever!" :)</p>

                        <p>However, I ended up not following the technology area, in fact, I started working in the Port of Lisbon, where I have worked for more than 8 years of my life. When I felt psychologically prepared to take a university course, I
                            ended up choosing Marketing & Advertising, because I also want to understand how people's minds work in terms of a willingness to acquire something and at the same time, making the brand of what they acquired as an extension
                            of their person && personality.

                            <p>I believe this passion for how humans behave in Society appeared during my experience in Aveiro, while working for ACAD - Associação Cultural de Aradas. This association was created with the pretext of joining people together
                                from the Parish of Aradas with the Cultural pretext, while getting to know each other better in the neighboor.</p>

                            <p>Then I've worked here and there, for great brands in the Digital Entertainment, such as
                                <strong>Supercell && Ubisoft</strong> and it was while I was working for the later on, that I've realized that what I really love, it's programming. I love to find solutions for common problems. In fact, I started working
                                next to the Developer team regarding some Legacy issues the game had that were persisting for some time. Unfortunately not everything was smooth sailing, and eventually I had to abandon that ship because there were no perspectives
                                of developing myself further within this industry, even as a Brand Manager.</p>

                            <p>Nowadays I am studying Fullstack, but I believe my main strength reveals itself within the Frontend, because I know how to work with Image Edition tools, such as Adobe Photoshop <i>/* which I have been using for 20 years now */</i>
                                I am currently working in my Portfolio with CodeCademy, since I don't have that many projects that I can show from &lt;Academia de Código_ &gt;, and I do hope you take your time to see them and call me for an interview
                                :)
                            </p>

                            <p>Another thing that I believe that is extremely important, I am looking for a Company that is able to take me with open arms and build a long-lasting relationship. I wish to have a mentor to look up to, and I do want to learn
                                from that person as much as possible.
